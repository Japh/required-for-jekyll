# Required for Jekyll

Required is a simple, clean theme for the modern blogger.

## Why?

[Required](http://8bit.io/required/) is a WordPress theme by [8BIT](http://8bit.io/), which I converted into a Jekyll theme, using Michael Rose's [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) as a base.

I did this because I loved the look of Required, but I've been playing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) lately, and thought it'd be a fun exercise, and the GPL lets me  :)

## License

This theme is free and open source software, distributed under the [GNU General Public License](LICENSE) version 2 or later. So feel free to use this Jekyll theme.
